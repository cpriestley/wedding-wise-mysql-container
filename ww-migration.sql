We were never given a tasting even though it was built into the price. I asked multiple times. We finally were asked to come to the venue for another walk through to plan where things would go for both ceremony and reception and we would have a tasting at that meeting. Gave our availability. No response. Reached out again the next week with more availability and then they got back to us. Did not have a tasting. After that I was reaching out for over a week maybe 2 by phone and email about how many tables etc so that decor could adequately be planned. No response. I then started just contacting the venue and not the coordinator directly and was passed to someone else that said they would be taking over from there. I was then basically called and asked everything we were asked when we had last met with the coordinator at the venue (where we were wanting things etc). Clearly that meeting was pointless. This call was literally weeks before the wedding. Wedding day came and their venue set up workers were not on time and would not let my coordinator and helpers set up do to liability since their people WEREN\'T THERE YET. This was all going on while I was getting ready off site so I was in the dark until I got there. There may have been other mishaps I\'m forgetting during that set up but again I was not there. Of course I wasn\'t 100% happy with the food. UGH. Most of it was great however if we had a tasting I definitely would\'ve axed 2 of the items. Specifically the chicken and waffles.

We had originally reached out for a floral arrangement quote early June, and to our relief, CiCi & Imelda had a response in the inbox the next day. It was a great sign for us and our short, 3-month engagement. They included in their quote a very reasonable offer for additional services: a day of coordinator. The Bride had always wanted a day of coordinator, but thought it wasn‚Äôt in the cards. The Groom was confused by the concept and was immediately against the idea. He is now one of CiCi and Imelda‚Äôs biggest fans and more than willing to admit he lived to eat his words, with, ‚Äúfind CiCi‚Äù becoming a reliable response on our big day! As for the Bride, she felt like she had a team to work with, not just organizing the wedding day itself, but also executing her dream. She had always wanted a fairytale wedding and was afraid to allow herself to hope for one. She had to admit it was everything she envisioned and more ‚Äì so much of that was due to their efforts.
